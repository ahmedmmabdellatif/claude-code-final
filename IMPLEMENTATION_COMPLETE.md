  workoutDays: [
    {
      day: string;
      name: string;
      exercises: [
        {
          exerciseId: string; // References CMS Exercise.id
          sets: number;
          reps: string;
          rest: number;

    dailyMeals: [
      {
        name: string;
        time: string;
        foods: [
          {

            servings: number;
            notes?: string;
          }
        ];
        totalCalories: number;

    targetCarbs: number;
    targetFat: number;
  };
  reasoning: string[];

### 3. Plan Assignment with Task Creation ✓
**Status:** FULLY IMPLEMENTED

**Location:**
- `backend/trpc/routes/coach/assign-plan/route.ts` - Complete plan assignment with versioning and task creation

**Features:**
- ✅ Creates Plan record in database with version control
- ✅ Archives previous active plans
- ✅ Auto-increments version number
- ✅ Creates Task records for each workout day
- ✅ Creates Task records for each meal
- ✅ Schedules tasks across plan duration (weeks)
- ✅ Maps workout days to calendar dates
- ✅ Sets client planStatus to "active"
- ✅ Stores full plan structure (workoutDays, mealPlan) as JSON
- ✅ Returns task count and sample tasks

**Task Generation Logic:**
1. For each week in plan duration:
   - Creates workout tasks for each workout day
   - Maps day name to calendar date
   - Creates meal tasks for all 7 days
2. All tasks are linked to plan via `planId`
3. Tasks are linked to client via `clientId`
4. Tasks start with `status: "pending"`

**Plan Versioning:**
- Version 1: Initial plan
- Version 2+: Updated plans (previous versions archived)
- Only one plan can be "active" at a time per client
