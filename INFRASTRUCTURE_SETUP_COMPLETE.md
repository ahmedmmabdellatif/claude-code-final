### 5. Documentation Created 📚

**Setup Guides:**
1. `DATABASE_SETUP.md` - Complete database setup walkthrough
2. `.env.example` - Environment variables template
3. `INFRASTRUCTURE_SETUP_COMPLETE.md` - This file

**Key Sections:**
- Quick 5-step setup
- Provider comparisons (Neon, Supabase, Railway, Local)
- Migration patterns with before/after examples
- Troubleshooting guide
- Production checklist

---

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Choose Database Provider

**Recommended: Neon (Free tier)**
```bash
# 1. Go to neon.tech
# 2. Create project
# 3. Copy connection string
```

**Alternatives:**
- Supabase (supabase.com)
- Railway (railway.app)
- Local PostgreSQL

### Step 2: Configure Environment

Create `.env` file:
```bash
# Required
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:5432/dbname"

# Optional (for cloud storage)
STORAGE_PROVIDER="cloudinary"  # or "s3" or "mock"
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="your_name"
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="your_key"
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="your_secret"

# Or for S3
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your_key"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your_secret"
AWS_S3_BUCKET="your_bucket"
AWS_S3_REGION="us-east-1"
```

### Step 3: Setup Database

```bash
# Install tsx for running seed script
bun add -d tsx

# Generate Prisma Client
bunx prisma generate

# Push schema to database
bunx prisma db push

# Seed initial data
bunx tsx prisma/seed.ts
```

### Step 4: Verify Setup

```bash
# Open Prisma Studio (browser UI)
bunx prisma studio

# Test login with seeded accounts:
# Coach: coach@example.com / password123
# Client: client@example.com / password123
```

## 📊 Database Schema Highlights

### User System
```
User
├── CoachProfile (specialty, years experience)
└── ClientProfile (adherence, plan status)
    ├── OnboardingData (age, goals, injuries)
    ├── Plans (workout/meal with versions)
    ├── Tasks (daily workouts, meals)
    ├── Goals (weight, performance, habits)
    ├── Measurements (weight, chest, arms...)
    └── Subscriptions (payment tracking)
```

### Content Management
```
Exercise (muscleGroup, difficulty, videoUrl)
Food (calories, protein, carbs, fat)
ProgramOffer (price, duration, features)
```

### Communication
```
Message (chatId, sender, attachments)
Alert (type, severity, resolution)
Notification (type, read status)
```

---

## 🔄 Migration Status

### ✅ Fully Migrated (5 routes)
- Authentication (login, register)
- CMS Exercises (list, create, update, delete)
- Goals (list with filtering)
- Media Upload (with cloud storage)

### 🔜 Needs Migration (20+ routes)
- CMS Foods
- Coach Client Management
- Goals (create, update, complete, delete)
- Measurements
- Messages
- Notifications
- Payments/Offers
- Plans
- Questionnaires
- Tracking Stats

**Migration Pattern:**
```typescript
// 1. Import prisma
import prisma from '../../../../db';

// 2. Replace mock array with query
const items = await prisma.model.findMany();

// 3. Add try/catch with logging
try {
  // ... query
} catch (error) {
  console.error('[Route] Error:', error);
  throw new Error('Descriptive message');
}
```

---

## 🐛 Known Issues & Considerations

### 1. ID Type Changes
**Before:** `id: number`  
**After:** `id: string` (cuid)

**Impact:** Frontend components expecting numbers need updating

**Fix:** Update input schemas and UI components:
```typescript
// Old
z.object({ id: z.number() })

// New
z.object({ id: z.string() })
```

### 2. Date Serialization
**Issue:** Prisma returns Date objects, need ISO strings for JSON

**Fix:** Convert dates in responses:
```typescript
createdAt: item.createdAt.toISOString()
```

### 3. Lint Warnings
**Warning:** "Using exported name 'prisma' as identifier for default import"

**Impact:** None - just a warning

**Fix (optional):** Change export in `backend/db.ts` or ignore

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Prisma Client Generation**: Run `bunx prisma generate` after any schema changes
2. **Environment Variables**: Never commit `.env` to git
3. **Database Backups**: Set up automated backups in production
4. **Migration vs Push**: Use `migrate` for production, `push` for development
5. **Cloud Storage**: Mock storage is fine for testing, but configure real storage before launch
