## ✅ CORE WORKFLOWS (Complete)

### 1. Client Registration → Onboarding → Label Extraction ✅

#### Implementation Details
**Files:**
- `backend/trpc/routes/auth/register/route.ts` - User registration with Prisma
- `backend/trpc/routes/onboarding/submit/route.ts` - Onboarding data storage
- `backend/services/labelExtractor.ts` - AI-powered label extraction
- `backend/trpc/routes/labels/extract/route.ts` - Label API endpoint

**Flow:**
1. User registers → Creates `User` + `ClientProfile` in database
2. Client submits onboarding → Stores in `OnboardingData` table
3. System extracts labels → AI analyzes onboarding data
4. Labels stored → `ClientLabel` table with categories (goal, health, preference, etc.)
5. Client status updated → `planStatus: 'pending'`

**Database Tables Used:**
- `User` - Authentication and profile
- `ClientProfile` - Client-specific data
- `OnboardingData` - Immutable onboarding responses
- `ClientLabel` - Extracted intelligent labels

**Key Features:**
- Bcrypt password hashing
- Automatic membership number generation
- Label extraction with confidence scores
- Category-based label organization (goal, health, preference, experience, constraint, metric)

---

### 2. AI Plan Generation (Label + CMS Data) ✅

#### Implementation Details
**Files:**
- `backend/services/aiPlanGenerator.ts` - Core AI plan generation logic
- `backend/trpc/routes/coach/ai-suggestions/route.ts` - API endpoint for plan generation
- `backend/trpc/routes/cms/exercises/route.ts` - Exercise CRUD operations
- `backend/trpc/routes/cms/foods/route.ts` - Food CRUD operations

**Flow:**
1. Coach requests AI plan → Provides `clientId`
2. System fetches:
   - Client onboarding data
   - Extracted labels
   - ALL exercises from CMS
   - ALL foods from CMS
3. System filters:
   - Exercises: Removes contraindicated based on injuries
   - Foods: Removes based on dietary restrictions
   - Difficulty: Matches client experience level
4. AI generates plan:
   - Uses filtered CMS data
   - Respects client labels
   - Creates workout schedule
   - Builds meal plan with macros
5. Returns structured plan → Coach can review/edit

**Database Tables Used:**
- `Exercise` - CMS exercise library
- `Food` - CMS food library  
- `ClientLabel` - Client-specific constraints
- `OnboardingData` - Client goals and preferences

**AI Integration:**
- Uses `@rork/toolkit-sdk` for generateObject
- Structured output with Zod schema validation
- Real-time filtering based on health constraints
- Macro calculation based on goals

**Safety Features:**
- Contraindication checking (knee injury → no squats)
- Dietary restriction enforcement (vegan → no meat)
- Experience-appropriate exercise selection

---

### 3. Plan Assignment → Task Creation ✅

#### Implementation Details
**Files:**
- `backend/trpc/routes/coach/assign-plan/route.ts` - Plan assignment with task generation

**Flow:**
1. Coach assigns plan → Provides plan data + start date
2. System creates `Plan` record:
   - Increments version number
   - Archives previous active plans
   - Sets status to 'active'
3. System generates tasks:
   - **Workout tasks**: One per workout day per week
   - **Meal tasks**: Daily for entire plan duration
   - Scheduled across plan duration (e.g., 12 weeks = 12 * 7 * meals)
4. Updates client status → `planStatus: 'active'`
5. Triggers notification → Habit questionnaire prompt

**Database Tables Used:**
- `Plan` - Plan metadata and structure
- `Task` - Individual actionable tasks
- `ClientProfile` - Status updates
- `Notification` - User notifications

**Task Generation Logic:**
- Intelligent date calculation (respects day of week)
- Bulk task creation (efficient database operations)
- Type-specific fields (exercises for workouts, calories for meals)
- Status tracking (pending, complete, partial, missed)

**Versioning:**
- Plans are never overwritten
- Each update creates new version
- Previous versions archived (not deleted)
- Full audit trail

---

### 4. Task Completion → Adherence Tracking ✅

#### Implementation Details
**Files:**
- `backend/trpc/routes/workouts/complete/route.ts` - Task completion handler
- Adherence calculation built-in

**Flow:**
1. Client marks task complete → Provides `taskId`, `status`, optional `notes`/`mediaUrls`
2. System updates task:
   - Sets `status` (complete, partial, missed)
   - Records `completedAt` timestamp
   - Stores `setsCompleted` count
3. System recalculates adherence:
   - Counts all scheduled tasks up to today
   - Counts completed + partial tasks
   - Calculates percentage: `(completed / total) * 100`
4. Updates client profile:
   - `ClientProfile.adherence` → New percentage
   - `ClientProfile.lastCheckin` → Current timestamp

**Database Tables Used:**
- `Task` - Task status and completion data
- `ClientProfile` - Aggregated metrics

**Real-Time Updates:**
- Immediate adherence recalculation on every task completion
- No cached data - always current
- Basis for alert generation

---

### 5. Alert Generation (Real Adherence Data) ✅

#### Implementation Details
**Files:**
- `backend/trpc/routes/alerts/generate/route.ts` - Alert generation system

**Flow:**
1. System checks adherence → Can be triggered manually or via cron
2. For each client:
   - **Weekly completion rate**: Tasks in last 7 days
   - **Last activity date**: Most recent check-in
   - **Progress stagnation**: Weight change over 2 weeks
3. Generates alerts based on thresholds:
   - **Very Low Adherence** (<40%): High severity alert
   - **Low Adherence** (40-60%): Medium severity alert
   - **Missed Check-In** (>3 days): Medium/High severity
   - **Progress Plateau** (weight stable 2+ weeks): Low severity
4. Stores in database → Prevents duplicate alerts

**Database Tables Used:**
- `Task` - Adherence calculation source
- `Measurement` - Progress tracking
- `ClientProfile` - Last check-in tracking
- `Alert` - Generated alerts

**Smart Alert Logic:**
- Deduplication: Won't create duplicate alerts within time window
- Severity escalation: Low adherence → Very low adherence
- Multiple data sources: Tasks + measurements + timestamps
- Actionable insights: Includes specific metrics in alert data

**Alert Types Implemented:**
- `low_adherence` - 40-60% completion
- `very_low_adherence` - <40% completion
- `missed_checkin` - No activity >3 days
- `progress_plateau` - Weight unchanged 2+ weeks

---

### 6. 30-Day Questionnaire System ✅

#### Implementation Details
**Files:**
- `backend/services/questionnaireScheduler.ts` - Automated scheduling logic
- `backend/trpc/routes/cron/check-questionnaires/route.ts` - Cron endpoint
- `backend/trpc/routes/questionnaires/submit/route.ts` - Response storage
- `backend/trpc/routes/questionnaires/compare/route.ts` - Version comparison

**Flow:**
1. **Auto-trigger** (via cron or manual):
   - Finds clients active for 30+ days
   - Checks last monthly questionnaire date
   - Sends notification if due
2. **Client completes**:
   - Opens questionnaire from notification
   - Fills form (similar to onboarding)
   - Submits responses
3. **System stores**:
   - Creates `QuestionnaireResponse` with type='monthly'
   - Links to client
   - Timestamps creation
4. **Coach compares**:
   - Fetches original onboarding
   - Fetches latest monthly response
   - Side-by-side comparison
   - Identifies changes and progress

**Database Tables Used:**
- `ClientProfile` - Start date tracking
- `QuestionnaireResponse` - Versioned responses
- `Notification` - Trigger system

**Comparison Features:**
- Read-only access to original onboarding
- Side-by-side field comparison
- Automatic change detection
- Basis for plan updates

### 7. Coach Dashboard (Real Metrics) ✅

#### Implementation Details
**Files:**
- `backend/trpc/routes/coach/clients/route.ts` - Client list with real data
- `backend/trpc/routes/coach/client-detail/route.ts` - Individual client details
- `backend/trpc/routes/alerts/list/route.ts` - Alert feed

**Flow:**
