3. ✅ Multi-user support
4. ✅ File uploads ready for cloud storage
5. ✅ Production-ready authentication

### Next Steps Unlocked

3. Enable cloud file storage
4. Complete remaining route migrations
5. Launch MVP to real users

---

## 🚀 Quick Start Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
bun add -d tsx
```

### 2. Set Up Database

**Choose a provider:**
- **Neon** (recommended): [neon.tech](https://neon.tech)
- **Supabase**: [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
- **Railway**: [railway.app](https://railway.app)
- **Local**: Install PostgreSQL

### 3. Configure Environment

Create `.env`:
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:5432/dbname"
```

### 4. Initialize Database
```bash
# Generate Prisma Client
bunx prisma generate

# Create tables
bunx prisma db push

# Seed data
bunx tsx prisma/seed.ts

# Verify (opens browser)
bunx prisma studio
```

### 5. Test
Login with:
- **Coach:** `coach@example.com` / `password123`
- **Client:** `client@example.com` / `password123`

---

## 📝 Migration Pattern

For remaining routes, follow this pattern:

```typescript
// Before (mock data)
export const listItems = publicProcedure.query(async () => {
  return { items: mockItems };
});

// After (Prisma)
import prisma from '../../../../db';

export const listItems = publicProcedure.query(async () => {
  try {
    const items = await prisma.item.findMany({
      orderBy: { createdAt: 'desc' },
    });
    return { items };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('[Items] Error:', error);
    throw new Error('Failed to fetch items');
  }
});
```

**Key changes:**
1. Import Prisma client
2. Replace mock arrays with database queries
3. Add try/catch error handling
4. Convert IDs from `number` to `string`
5. Serialize Date objects to ISO strings

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### ID Type Changes
- **Before:** `id: number`
- **After:** `id: string` (cuid)
- **Action:** Update frontend components and input schemas

### Date Handling
- Prisma returns Date objects
- Convert to ISO strings: `item.createdAt.toISOString()`

### Environment Variables
- Never commit `.env` to git
- Add to `.gitignore`
- Use `.env.example` as template

### Prisma Commands
```bash
bunx prisma generate        # After schema changes
bunx prisma db push         # Push schema (dev)
bunx prisma migrate dev     # Create migration (prod)
bunx prisma studio          # View data
bunx prisma format          # Format schema
```
