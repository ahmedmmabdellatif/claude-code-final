## 📊 System Integration Verification

### What You Asked For
> "Confirm that all systems in the app are correlated and dependent on each other... no stand alone system or hard coded one."

### ✅ Verification

#### CMS → AI Dependency
- ❌ **Before**: AI used hardcoded exercises
- ✅ **Now**: AI reads from `Exercise` and `Food` tables
- ✅ **Impact**: Coach can add exercises, AI immediately uses them

#### Onboarding → Labels Dependency
- ❌ **Before**: Labels were static
- ✅ **Now**: Labels extracted from onboarding data
- ✅ **Impact**: Every client has personalized labels

#### Labels → AI Plan Dependency
- ❌ **Before**: AI ignored client specifics
- ✅ **Now**: AI uses labels to filter and personalize
- ✅ **Impact**: Plans are truly individualized

#### Tasks → Adherence Dependency
- ❌ **Before**: Adherence was hardcoded
- ✅ **Now**: Calculated from task completion
- ✅ **Impact**: Real-time, accurate tracking

#### Adherence → Alerts Dependency
- ❌ **Before**: Alerts were mocked
- ✅ **Now**: Generated based on adherence thresholds
- ✅ **Impact**: Actionable, data-driven alerts

#### Plan → Tasks Dependency
- ❌ **Before**: Tasks were separate from plans
- ✅ **Now**: Tasks generated from plan structure
- ✅ **Impact**: Changing plan creates new task set

#### Time → Questionnaire Dependency
- ❌ **Before**: No automation
- ✅ **Now**: Auto-triggered after 30 days
- ✅ **Impact**: Ensures regular progress checks

**Result: Zero standalone systems. Everything is interconnected.**
