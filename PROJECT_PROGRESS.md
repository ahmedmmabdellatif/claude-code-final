2. **Video Player:** Basic implementation needs optimization for performance.
3. **Image Handling:** No image upload functionality yet (needs expo-image-picker).
4. **Real-time:** No WebSocket implementation for live updates.
5. **Auth:** JWT tokens not persisted properly across app restarts.
6. **Error Handling:** Some screens missing comprehensive error states.
7. **Offline Support:** No offline queue for actions performed while offline.
8. **Testing:** No unit tests or E2E tests implemented.
